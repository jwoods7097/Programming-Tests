# Java Test

1. We want our robot's speed to be dependent on the color of the surface it is under. Lighter colors should make the robot go faster and darker colors should make the robot go slower. Black should make the robot stop completely. For the purpose of this exercise, the drive base can be simplified to one motor. Write a class that can accomplish these specifications.

2. A guide to launch a ball into a goal uses a piston to extend it. There happens to be an obstacle on the field that is the perfect distance for launching the ball, so we can use a switch to control the extension of the piston. Write a class that can accomplish these specifications.
